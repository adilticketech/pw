/*
 * This CSS rule now targets the div element with the class 'event-and-time-details'.
 * Setting 'display: none' will completely remove it from the visual layout,
 * making the title (and potentially the time, if it's within the same div)
 * invisible and ensuring it doesn't take up any space.
 * The '!important' flag is added to ensure this rule overrides any default
 * styling that the ParkWhiz widget might apply to this element.
